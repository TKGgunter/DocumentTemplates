# Monthly Business Report

The report is for upper level management and should include the team, and
dependant partner teams. The purpose of the report is to justify the team,
communicate the team's current direction, and identify blockers.


## Introduction

Provide a brief introduction to the team, what the team owns and what services
the teams provides. Describe the team's objectives for year. Goals should be
well defined and echoed through out the document.


## Customer and business wins

This section should contains the business developments that can be justified as
wins. Improvements to process, product as well as customer onboards all fall
within the topic. Don't be afraid to call out caveats here. Sun shine and
rainbows make it difficult to make decisions. The section is organized as a set
of short lists summarizing the above.


## Misses, risks and dogs not barking

Bullets here should provide visibility and leverage from upper management. The
list should grow, change, update over the source of the service. It should
indicate what's been tried, succeeded and failed at addressing misses and
reducing risks.

completion means.
