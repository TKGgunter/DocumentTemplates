# ORR

ORR generally consist of a multiple choice question and a dialogue box to provide additional context. For an internal ORR we need to do 3 things. 

1. Give answers to the multiple choice questions.
1. Clearly give the answers to the dialogue box questions.
1. Give the team additional context so that they can better understand our service, the question and how I am answering the question.
